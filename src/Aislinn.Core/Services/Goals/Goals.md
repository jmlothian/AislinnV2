# Goal System Capabilities

## Core Goal Representation

- Goals as specialized chunks with slots for status, priority, completion criteria
- Goal templates for parameter specification and reuse
- Hierarchical goals with parent-child relationships
- Dependencies between goals with automatic status updates
- Status tracking (Pending, Active, Blocked, InProgress, Completed, Failed, Abandoned)

## Goal Instantiation

- Template-based goal creation with parameter validation
- Required and optional parameter handling
- Default parameter application
- Parent-child relationship creation
- Automatic association establishment

## Goal Completion Mechanisms

- Multiple completion criteria types (dictionary, expression, reference, subgoals)
- Multi-path fulfillment with OR conditions
- Transitive relationship matching through semantic networks
- Automatic subgoal completion propagation to parents
- Dependency satisfaction tracking and updates

## Relationship Matching

- Transitive relationship navigation (e.g., "Dog IsA Animal IsA LivingThing")
- Bidirectional BFS for efficient relationship traversal
- Performance optimization through caching
- Support for multiple relationship types (IsA, HasPart, MadeOf, CanDo)
- Integration with existing expression evaluation

## Goal Activation

- Priority-based activation boosting
- Dependency-aware activation reduction for blocked goals
- Goal completion detection during activation cycles
- Context-aware activation adjustment
- Activation spreading through goal relationships

## Goal Structures

- Multiple fulfillment paths for social and complex goals
- Expression syntax with AND/OR combinators
- Relationship-pattern conditions
- Comparison operators (==, !=, >=, <=)
- Type-safe value comparison across data types

# TODO

## Goal Selection and Execution

- No mechanism for selecting which goal to actively pursue
- Missing prioritization algorithm for competing goals
- No action selection tied to active goals
- No execution monitoring or progress tracking

## Dynamic Goal Generation

- Lacks ability to autonomously generate goals based on needs/context
- No motivational systems driving goal creation
- Missing opportunistic goal recognition
- No ability to generate subgoals from abstract goals

## Goal Reasoning

- No mechanisms for goal conflict detection and resolution
- Missing cost-benefit analysis for goal selection
- No planning capabilities to determine goal approach
- Lacks goal reformulation when obstacles encountered

## Context Integration

- Limited integration with perception system
- No emotional influence on goal priorities
- Missing situational awareness affecting goal relevance
- Limited environmental condition monitoring

## Learning and Adaptation

- No reinforcement learning for goal success strategies
- Missing reward signals for completed goals
- No adaptation of goal parameters based on experience
- No learning of goal relationships or dependencies

## Meta-Cognition

- No self-reflection on goal success rates
- Missing goal maintenance and reprioritization
- No introspection capabilities for goal adjustment
- Missing abandonment criteria for unachievable goals

## Time Management

- No consideration of deadlines or temporal constraints
- Missing goal scheduling based on urgency
- No handling of cyclical or recurring goals
- Limited temporal context awareness
